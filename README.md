## Overview

Celery Executor isn’t just another executor—it’s a task-splitting, speed-boosting, backend-flexing beast made for Windows PC. 💻 It works by distributing execution steps to different workers, letting you run multiple scripts seamlessly. Powered by a Celery backend like RabbitMQ or Redis, this executor was made for high-demand workflows and serious parallel power.

It’s optimized for scalable execution, letting you handle larger jobs or multiple queued tasks without choking your system. If you’re tired of one-script-at-a-time lagfests, Celery Executor is the upgrade you've been waiting for. 🔥

## Feature Breakdown 🛠️

**🧠 Scalable Worker Distribution**  
Scale out task execution across multiple workers using RabbitMQ, Redis, or Redis Sentinel. More tasks, less lag, all systems go.

**⚙️ Backend Coordination**  
Uses a Celery backend to sync execution between different workers. That means fewer bottlenecks and maximum throughput.

**🚀 Fast & Efficient Task Execution**  
This executor is optimized for speed and smooth execution, letting your scripts load and fire in record time.

**🎯 Multi-Queue Support**  
Assign different task types to specific worker queues in your DAG code—giving you laser-precision over how scripts run.

**📡 Distributed Architecture**  
Celery Executor shines in distributed environments, letting you offload heavy lifting to multiple nodes across your system.

**🧩 Seamless Integration**  
Works with DAG-based systems and compiles jobs into solid execution plans that are broker-ready.

**🔁 Configurable Resource Management**  
Define how many workers you want and how much power they get—before the session even begins.

**💪 Fault Tolerance**  
If a worker crashes, the system reroutes the task. That’s high reliability for low-stress scripting.

## Why Our Executor Obliterates the Competition 💥

Celery Executor crushes rivals by offering a more scalable and fault-tolerant execution system. 🧨 With the ability to distribute tasks across multiple worker nodes, it eliminates lag, crashes, and performance hitches. You don’t just run scripts—you deploy them with a battle plan, backed by Redis or RabbitMQ and configured for chaos-free conquest.

Plus, with multi-queue support and full backend coordination, Celery Executor gives you full control of how scripts behave across your PC infrastructure. Say goodbye to one-and-done executors. This is the future of parallel execution. 🛸
